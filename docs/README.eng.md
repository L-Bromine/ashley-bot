**Ashley's life only have 16 talks. I want to give her a full life.**


Ashley Bot，艾希 Bot.

A QQ Bot written in Python, built with OpenAI's API, based on AliceBot and mirai.

> **Warning**: Ashley bot is still under heavy development. Some feature may be changed in future version.

## How To Use

### Pre-work

#### Available access to mirai-http-api
Make sure that you have stable access to `mirai-http-api` with a QQ bot logged in.


#### (Optional) Use proxy

Make sure that you have stable connection to OpenAI API service. If not,
you must use a proxy to ensure it. The type of your proxy must be `sock` listening to port `1080`.

> **Note**: This feature may changed in the future. Using http proxy or change port number is not support at current time.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
$ python -m venv venv # You should create a virtualenv first. :-)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Set OpenAI API Key

Depend on your OS, set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` and make sure the bot can read it.

The API key can be found (or generate it) in [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com). 
#### Modify the configures

After install requirements, rename the `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` and `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`.
Follow the tips in file, to create your version.

### Run

Using command below to start your bot.

```bash
$ python main.py
```

##### (Optional) Deploy with Docker or Supervisor

*Coming Soon*
